//! **Phase 3 — the edit vocabulary as NODE TRANSFORMS.**
//!
//! Arm 1 is declaration type replacement: `*mut T` → `&mut T`, `*const T` →
//! `&T`, on the subjects the decision layer settled `Decision::Ref`.
//!
//! # What changes, and what conspicuously does not
//!
//! The decision layer is untouched — this module consumes a `DecisionTable` and
//! decides nothing. What changes is that an edit stops being
//! `(lo, hi, replacement: String)` and becomes a mutation of a `TyKind`.
//!
//! **The pointee is not copied, it is KEPT.** The span layer had to reproduce
//! the pointee's source text (`plan` copied `pointee_span`'s snippet); here the
//! pointee is a subtree that moves across unchanged. Whole classes of question —
//! is the pointee text renderable, does it contain a macro, is its span
//! contained in the declaration's — stop existing rather than being answered.
//!
//! # Parity mode
//!
//! Capability unlocks are OFF. This arm reproduces what the span layer produces
//! for the same subjects and nothing more; the differential against the pinned
//! oracle (`b4294374`, digest `4ed9d2a6…`) is what says so.

/// # What it does and does not replace
///
/// The `seam-site-overlap` gate's *byte-range conflict* dissolves with the
/// representation — two node transforms at one call site compose, where two
/// byte ranges could not. **The soundness hazard it guarded does not dissolve.**
/// What that gate stands between is the inversion finding: `two_mut(&mut *p,
/// &mut *p)` through a raw base compiles with **zero diagnostics** where the
/// same shape on a real local is `E0499`. The compiler is blind exactly where
/// the reborrow family places its borrows, so refusing unreviewed composition
/// is the only thing between a composed transform and silent UB.
///
/// This guard is the STRUCTURAL half: two transforms may not claim one node.
/// The semantic half stays in the decision layer, where it already lives.
///
/// **Fail-closed:** a second claim on a node is REFUSED and counted. It is
/// never resolved by precedence, because a precedence rule is a decision, and
/// deciding here is what the phase separation forbids.
